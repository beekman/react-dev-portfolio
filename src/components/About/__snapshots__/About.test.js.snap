      <p>
        I'm a full-stack web and software engineer with an entrepreneurial background in front-end web development, SEO, and education. I'm enthusiastic about creating code that solves human-centered problems and I love learning and teaching new techniques and technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a full-stack web engineer role at a startup, I spent the past fifteen months working on a wide variety of web-based software and plugins to aid with internal multi-departmental processes. Before that, I spent more than a decade developing and designing websites.
