        Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a full-stack developer with a background as an entrepreneur in front-end web development, SEO and education. I'm passionate about clean code that solves human-centric problems, learning and teaching new approaches and technologies, and making a meaningful impact for the companies and teams I work for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have over a decade of professional experience with web development and design and a degree in multimedia design. Over time, I fell in love with programming, and drilled deeply into full-stack JavaScript development. My programming language of choice is JavaScript, but it's not the only one I've worked with professionally. My work with Python and PHP makes me a more well rounded and flexible developer.
