Since earning my U of O degree in Multimedia Design, I've spent more than a decade helping people harness the power of that technology. I've taught classes for young people, tutored older people, consulted for small businesses, co-authored technology textbooks, served as both design and IT department for a small media company, and designed and developed web sites for businesses, nonprofits, and individuals.",
